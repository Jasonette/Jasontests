# Jasontests

This repository is a collection of JSON markup documents exclusively for testing Jasonette, in order to keep track of all the edge cases and fixes.


If you're looking for a demo for all the Jasonette features, you should look at [Jasonpedia](https://github.com/Jasonette/Jasonpedia).

The reason the two are separate is because it would be inefficient to put all the edge cases into Jasonpedia whose purpose is exclusively for demo. Most of the edge cases and small units in this repository would be boring as a demo.

# Contribution

If you have a JSON markup that:

- should work but not working correctly
- appear drastically inconsistent across iOS and Android
- demonstrates any other weird behavior
